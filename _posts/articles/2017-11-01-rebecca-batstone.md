When mutualisms involve fitness costs, theory predicts that natural selection should favour partners that cheat¬ù (i.e., receive benefits without paying costs), potentially leading to mutualism breakdown. Traits that allow a focal mutualist to preferentially associate with or allocate rewards to more cooperative partners (i.e., preference traits) may maintain mutualism stability over evolutionary time, but how these traits evolve has been underexplored. Do preference traits evolve to exclude or punish (i.e., sanction) ineffective partners? Or do they evolve to better reward more cooperative partners? To test these questions, I conducted a series of whole- and split-root experiments using 35 lines of the model legume, *Medicago truncatula*, and two strains of rhizobia differing in their ability to fix nitrogen, one being effective and the other ineffective. I found robust support for the latter hypothesis: that preferences traits likely evolve to favour more effective partners. I then experimentally evolved the same two strains of rhizobia with five *M. truncatula* lines that showed marked variation in preference for the effective strain across five generations. I quantified the proportion of the two strains associating with each plant line at each generation, and found that the plant line exhibiting the strongest preference increased the proportion of the effective strain at a more rapid rate than the plant line exhibiting the weakest preference. Taken together, these results demonstrate that genetic variation in preference traits affects selection for cooperation on the symbiont population, and could explain why less effective partners persist in a population.
