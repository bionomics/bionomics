Mutualisms evolve and are maintained when one species receives benefits from benefiting another species. There are many mechanisms that can feed back the benefits provided to a partner to the one supplying it, including passive (e.g., by-product and various kinds of partner fidelity feedbacks) and active feedbacks (e.g., partner choice, sanctioning). While many of these mechanisms are well-understood individually, their interactions can produce unexpected patterns, especially in varying environments. In this talk, I will present models that incorporate multiple kinds of feedbacks operating in mutualisms and the complexity of outcomes that can result when they interact with each other. In particular, I will illustrate how combination of differ-ent mechanisms and context dependency can result in the maintenance of variation in mutual-isms.
