Unlike cooperative systems, where interacting agents put some effort together in order to achieve a common goal, in mutualistic systems, the agentsâ€™ goals may be very different and it is the interaction itself which is beneficial for the agents. The standard example of such systems is a plant-pollinator community, where the observed network of inter- actions shows a particular ordering called nested- ness [1]; however, mutualistic interactions may be observed also in socio-economic systems. In this talk we explain how the tools developed to study ecosystems help to understand the role of social interactions in trading. In a vast economic literature concerning marketsâ€™ organisation, it is widely accepted that auction markets are the most efficient way of organizing the exchanges [2]. However, it has recently been under- lined that, when there exists no signal of quality for the goods, bilateral transactions allow people to gather information and better evaluate goodâ€™s in- trinsic quality [3, 4]. We present a data based study of the Boulogne- Sur-Mer Fish Market, where the actors can daily choose to exchange either through a bilateral pro- cess or through an auction one. Since 2006, both sub-market forms operate at the same location, un- der the same conditions. Against what could have been expected, the more efficient structure taking over the other, both sub-markets coexist. Our results indicate that instead of compet- ing, these sub-markets seem complementary. We show that their specificities can be directly mea- sured from the corresponding interaction network, namely the development of trust relationships in the bilateral sub-market and the robustness of the auction one. This complementarity may be at the origin of the observed coexistence.
