In mutualisms, it is usually impossible to link a cost to the likelihood that a potential partner will behave cooperatively in the future, which prevents the use of costly, honest signalling for partner choice. In fact, signals like Nod factors in rhizobial bacteria, which form symbioses with leguminous plants, are evidence for cost-free, honest signals in situations of potential conflict. We suggest that because Nod factors are complex, they are impossible to evolve de novo and thus signal that the symbiont and host lineages share a mutualistic history, a system akin to a password or a lock-and-key. We show that passwords can evolve when the receiver is under soft selection, which occurs when high juvenile mortality does not lead to a corresponding reduction in fitness. Passwords might also apply to complex species-recognition signals in mate choice and in the acquisition of defensive symbionts.
