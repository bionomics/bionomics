excerpt: "Workshop on the biology and economics of mutualisms being held at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology"

### 1-3 November, 2017

### [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology](http://www.evolbio.mpg.de), Plön, Germany

Some ecosystems fail while others thrive.
At the heart of thriving ecosystems is often an intricate network of collaborative interactions between the associated species.
While considerable literature has been devoted to antagonistic interactions like those characteristic of host-parasite and predator-prey systems, facets of mutualism are still comparatively less understood.
In particular, how mutualistic interactions can be robust against invading cheats has been a matter of debate generating a large body of theory and novel experimental approaches.

Researchers from different fields are actively working towards a general understanding of mutualism.
[//]: # This community now consists of experimental and theoretical biologists, economists, physicists, and mathematicians.
Our goal is to put together members of this interdisciplinary community to foster mutual aid and synergistic interactions.
[//]: # After the initial surge of theoretical developments, it only makes sense that the theories are reviewed, and further directions planned out by the community.



### Registration

We are experimenting with a novel format where young researchers will be presenting their work as plenary talks.
Established researchers have happily agreed to present their extensive work in a short talk format.
Do check out the speakers list as it promises to be an exciting lineup.

If you are interested in presenting a short-talk do register starting **January 2017**.
Registrations will be open till **31st March 2017** and we will inform the selected participants in April.

Interested participants are requested to register for short-talks (30 mins) with the following information

- Presenters name, affiliation
