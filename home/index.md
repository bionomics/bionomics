### The Biology and Economics of Mutualisms Workshop

## 1st - 3rd November 2017

Mutualisms---between-species interactions beneficial to all organisms involved---are at the heart of many thriving ecosystems.
The objective of this workshop is to present the latest developments in the evolution of mutualisms and to demonstrate the important role played by interdisciplinary approaches drawing from economic theory in the study of such systems.
