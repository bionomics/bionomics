excerpt: "Workshop on the biology and economics of mutualisms being held at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology"

### 1-3 November, 2017

### [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology](http://www.evolbio.mpg.de), Pl√∂n, Germany

Some ecosystems fail while others thrive.
At the heart of thriving ecosystems is often an intricate network of collaborative interactions between the associated species.
While considerable literature has been devoted to antagonistic interactions like those characteristic of host-parasite and predator-prey systems, facets of mutualism are still comparatively less understood.
In particular, how mutualistic interactions can be robust against invading cheats has been a matter of debate generating a large body of theory and novel experimental approaches.

Researchers from different fields are actively working towards a general understanding of mutualism.
Our goal is to put together members of this interdisciplinary community to foster mutual aid and synergistic interactions.


### Registration

We are experimenting with a novel format where young researchers will be presenting their work as plenary talks.
Established researchers have happily agreed to present their extensive work in a short talk format.
Do check out the speakers list as it promises to be an exciting lineup.

If you are interested in presenting a short talk register starting **January 2017**.
Registrations will be open until **31st March 2017**.
We will inform the selected participants in **April 2017**.

Interested participants are requested to register for short talks (30 mins) with the following information:

- Name
- Affiliation
- Title
- Abstract

**Email address for registration and nominal fees will be announced in January, 2017.**
